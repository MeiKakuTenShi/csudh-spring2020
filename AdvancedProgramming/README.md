# Fundamentals and Concepts of Programming Languages
This course presents an in-depth study of the principles in the design, implementation, and application of programming languages.

Topics will vary from basic to advanced in areas such as syntax, semantics, binding, data abstraction, exception handling, 
concurrency, and functional, logic, and objected-oriented programming.

## Objectives

  1. Develop a good understanding of the issues involved in programming language design and implementation
  
  2. Develop an in-depth understanding of functional, logic, and object-oriented programming paradigms
  
  3. Implement programs in several languages (JavaScript, C, Python, Java, C++)
  
  4. Understand design/implementation issues involved with variable allocation and binding, control flow, types, subroutines, parameter passing
  
  5. Develop an understanding of the compilation process
