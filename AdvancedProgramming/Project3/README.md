# Binary Search Tree Traversal and Search Using Iterators In Java/C++

## Requirements
  Implement a binary search tree ADT with insertion and preorder, postorder and inorder traversal operations
  
  ###Task 1
  Read a list of strings from an input file and insert them into the binary search tree
  Traverse the tree in preorder, inorder and postorder manner and print the data in the tree on the screen
    (using the iterators in Java/C++)
  Asks the user to type a city’s name to search if the city is on the list, and then uses one of the iterative
    traversal to return “yes” or “no”.

  ###Task 2
  Make preorder, postorder and inorder traversal operations using recursion and printout the results accordingly.
  Asks the user to type a city’s name to search if the city is on the list, and then uses one of the recursive
    traversal to return “yes” or “no”.
