# Computer Architecture
This course provides comprehensive study of computer architectures to maximize performance and energy efficiency
of a computer while staying within cost, power, and availability constraint. The main focus is on the quantitative
analysis and cost-performance tradeoffs in instruction-set, pipeline, and memory design.
Specific topics covered include: quantitative performance measures, instruction set design, 
parallelism (mainly pipeline and instruction-level), and memory organization. Related topics such as data centers 
and cloud computing will also be covered.

## Objectives
  
  1. Understand organized approaches to determine the capabilities and performance of computing systems

  2. Understand the fundamentals of different instruction set architectures and their relationship to the CPU design

  3. Understand and effectively utilize modern advanced computer systems, and the operations of modern CPUs including pipelining and memory systems

  4. Understand different systems architectures and scalable computer systems
  
  5. Identify trade-offs in design, implementation, and performance issues in computer systems
  
  6. Design and emulate a single cycle or pipelined CPU using QtSpim simulator

  7. Keep up with state-of-the-art industry practice and academia research, by writing reports and making presentations about their computer architecture projects
