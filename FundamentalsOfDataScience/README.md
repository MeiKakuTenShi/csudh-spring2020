# Fundamentals of Data Science
The data analysis process is introduced and examined, and the mathematical fundamentals of data science 
are discussed, including probability and data statistics, Bayesian analysis, principle component analysis, 
linear algebra, linear regression, gradient descent, data distances, data classification, data clustering, 
graphic data analysis and Markov Chains.
