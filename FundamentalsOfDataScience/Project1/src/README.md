# Project 1

## Usage
Run 'python main.py' in terminal

Make sure there is directory called 'output' in directory of main.py.

All output generated by main.py will be saved there.

### Results
The heat map generated by the program shows a strong correlation between the following attributes:

    'alcohol' ~ 'quality'
    
    'free sulfur dioxide' ~ 'total sulfur dioxide'
    
    'fixed acidity' ~ 'density'
    
    'citric acid' ~ 'fixed acidity'

The most significant is the 'alcohol'/'quality' correlation because this means a consumer would score 
the overall quality of a red wine pending the amount of alcohol in the product.
